Ech0 (pronounced "echo zero") is a logging adapter for `echo.Logger` that uses [github.com/rs/zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) as the logging backend instead of the default [github.com/labstack/gommon/log](https://github.com/labstack/gommon/tree/master/log)

# Status

This is now archived. It was only ever transitional.

See instead github/issues/rickb777/httpclient for logging alternatives.
